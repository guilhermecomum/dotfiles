# Nicer RGB format for gdbus color picker response
# Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 using Wayland desktop
# This is one of my first Bash scripts. Please pardon my noobiness. Just needed the job done.
# Dependencies: bc

# Original code from: https://gist.github.com/byrro/7a74e54f63667bbb066fa309208a6cba

# Get the gdbus output with colors as floats
response=$(gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot --object-path /org/gnome/Shell/Screenshot --method org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot.PickColor)

# Clean up the gdbus output
colors=${response/"({'color': <("/""}
colors=${colors/")>},)"/""}

# Split colors to an array
IFS=',' read -ra colors <<< "$colors"

# Convert to 255-based RGB format (float)
red=$(echo "${colors[0]} * 255" | bc)
green=$(echo "${colors[1]} * 255" | bc)
blue=$(echo "${colors[2]} * 255" | bc)

# 255-based RGB format (integer)
red=${red%%.*}
green=${green%%.*}
blue=${blue%%.*}

result=$(printf 'HEX: #%02x%02x%02x\n' "$red" "$green" "$blue")
zenity --info --title="Captured color" --text="${result}"
